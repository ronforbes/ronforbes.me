I lead a team producing esports events around League of Legends at Riot Games. 

I was previously a program manager on the Kinect team on Xbox at Microsoft. 

I graduated from Virginia Tech with a BS in Computer Science. 

I play keyboard in a 90s R&B cover band called The Degenerates. I produce the band’s tracks. I used to play sax. 

I live in Venice, California.
