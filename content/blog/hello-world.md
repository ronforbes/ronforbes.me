## Hello friends.

I’m starting a new chapter as a product manager and game developer. I’m excited about the opportunity to recharge my batteries, reorient toward my next North Star™, apply some of the principles of product / project management I’ve been learning on the job to my personal life, and write about the experience of going through a pretty huge shift in career direction.

I’m going to write much more about this, but the circumstances leading to this new phase happened pretty abruptly. So after I recovered from the initial shock, I sat down to write a handful of goals to triage and manage my first week of a new life:
* Overhaul my personal brand
* Let people know about the change
* Get personal life setup to support the next few months of professional hiatus
* Start vision / strategy development on the product of my life(!)
* Take some time to connect with those I care about

I then did some sprint (week) planning and came up with a backlog of tasks that would support my goals, prioritized them based on importance and urgency (to which my former co-workers should be thinking, “But how are you defining ‘important’?”. Fair criticism to address in the next post.), and committed to accomplishing a subset of the backlog within the week. I’m tracking all of this in [Asana](https://asana.com/), one of my go-to project management tools for bootstrapping projects and teams. It’s lightweight, easy to setup, allows me to visualize work-in-progress and feel good as things get done. Perfect for my immediate needs. Part of my hope is that I can make these commitments public through this blog to create some sense of public accountability.

Once I can step back from this week’s tactical needs, I’m looking forward to focusing more on the product side, crafting a compelling vision of my future state, evaluating and making some strategic choices to navigate the way forward, creating a roadmap of goals for the year / quarter / month / week, which will give way to success measures and the next phase of weekly sprint planning. Hopefully, I can get into this on the next post.

There’s something exhilarating about the chance to prioritize and PM your life. I’m chronically bad at tooting my own horn, but I have to admit that I’ve accomplished some mildly miraculous things in the last 10 years of my professional life, and I’m excited to apply some of what I’ve learned in that life to my personal one. Only, if I fail on the job, my product gets cut; if I fail here, then I don’t eat :)
