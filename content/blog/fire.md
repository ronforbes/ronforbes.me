## Fired

Three weeks ago, I was fired from my job. 21 days later, I still stutter awkwardly around it when talking about it with friends and family, maybe out of fear of the judgement typically associated with it. But I’m coming to more peace with it day by day. Writing about it helps :)

The causes were performance-based. I did some great work over the past four years that came along with my role rapidly expanding in responsibility. Before long, I found myself in very new territory, setting long-term strategic direction, managing people’s performance and growth, overseeing product development by teams of hundreds. I was reading every book and seeking out mentorship on management wherever I could to keep pace with my changing responsibilities. However, the reality is that I fell behind and contributed to some major failures along the way. On Tuesday, May 1 of 2018, I walked into a meeting with management to present and seek feedback on a plan to course correct on some strategic priorities and team culture issues, and I was told that today would be my last with the company.

I was stunned. I’ve always been achievement-oriented, and despite previous failures and setbacks, I’ve always managed to learn from my mistakes and improve going forward. So it was incredibly difficult accepting that I just wasn’t growing at the rate that the job required. I grabbed my jacket from my desk and walked out of my office for the last time. 

The initial reaction of many of the friends and family I’ve confided in has been “#@%$ those guys,” and they’ve been surprised that I’m not more resentful toward the company that caused this abrupt life change. I feel quite the opposite. I’m still deeply invested emotionally (and financially) in the success of the company and people working there. I’m excited to see where they go in the future. Honestly, given the position they were in, I might have made the same decision in their shoes. Also, beside all of that, I’d been quietly planning for such a change to occur.

## FIRE

A funny thing happened when I woke up the next day. I had the most restful night of sleep in recent memory, naturally woke up with the sunrise, and thought to myself, “What do I want to do today?” The thoughts of how I would pay rent or put food on the table weren’t an immediate concern. Because as it turns out, I’d been planning for this moment for years. 

It started when I was a teenager and my Dad got me to read Rich Door, Poor Dad, teaching me the see in assets and liabilities. Then when I got my first job out of college, my brother-in-law, an investment manager, showed me how to setup a 401k and encouraged me to start saving. Over time, I found the [Personal Finance subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/), which then gave way to the [Finance Independence subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) and many blogs and podcasts on the subject. 

The community there talks about the term FIRE (financially independent retirement early) and the 4% rule: if you can amass 25 times your yearly living expenses in investments, you should be able to safely withdraw 4% indefinitely without ever dipping into your nest egg. This created a very practical, tangible goal to align my lifestyle around, manifesting in how I earn and spend.

All of this learning set me down a path that have put me in a financially secure position, enabling me to take at least the next few months to really think about where I want to take the next chapter of my career and life. It’s an amazing position to be in, and I feel incredibly fortunate to be where I am.

## Lighting the Fire

I read a recent [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2011/11/fire-snowball-mask-movie-how-leaders-spark-and-sustain-change) article about how leaders "spark and sustain change". It talks about this often used metaphor of fire. We often find ourselves frantically trying to put out the fires around us: falling profits, unfortunate staff turnover, failing health, personal insecurities. And so it’s easy to start executing your career and life out of fear. And fear can certainly be a necessary motivator at times. But it turns out that aspiration and purpose are far more sustainable motivators. “Sustainable change requires the fire of a ‘burning ambition.’”

My second thought after waking up that day was, “Everyone should have this.” It’s incredibly liberating to wake up at my own pace and be able to focus on exactly what I want to do. It’s amazing knowing that even without a paycheck, the following are still true: I’m healthy. I have an amazing support system of friends, family and local community. I’m still incredibly career driven and growing in my ability to have an impact on society. 

And I’m building wealth while I sleep. I’m not at a point where I can sustain this lifestyle indefinitely (yet), but I see it in very tangible terms, and I’m on the path toward it. And I understand my financial situation sufficiently to know the time horizon by which I need to make the next major decision about building income. The world would be a better place if more people were empowered with this understanding to benefit their day-to-day decision making. In the very short term, I’ll be working towards creating income through independent game development, freelance development, and product management consulting. I have some huge ideas in mind about games, apps, and other ways to help people lead better, more enjoyable, fulfilling lives. Over time, I’m looking forward to focusing on these big burning ambitions, building toward a future where we can all wake up and ask ourselves, “What do I want to do today?” More on that in a future post :)
